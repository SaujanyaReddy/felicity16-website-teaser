### For making changes in styles
You can edit the css file directly or optionally (and recommended) the source
scss file. (Don't use both ways. gulp will overide the css file and you'll lose your changes in it)

**For using scss file**, you need to use gulp. Run `npm install` (You need to have npm already installed) and then
`npm run-script gulp` for developing or `npm run-script build` for just building
